very WIP, do not use

almost all features are not yet implemented
header files are documented
samples on using the engine will be added as it reaches a finished state

currently the makefile only compiles for windows using g++
the GLFW and GLEW library files are for 64 bit windows

external libraries (not mine):
glew
glfw			https://github.com/glfw/glfw
stb_image 		https://github.com/nothings/stb
